![](https://photos.app.goo.gl/uVx8MKU2G9bCi3BZ8)

Deployed @[https://aamir-catapp.netlify.app/](https://aamir-catapp.netlify.app/)

This project uses ReactJS and AWS Amplify to show the list of cats, you can add a cat's record or delete any of the added cat's record.

## Development

You need `npm` / `yarn` to run this application. I have `yarn` here.

### Setup

```
git clone https://github.com/aamiriqubal/cat-list.git
cd cat-list
yarn install
yarn start
```

## Visual regression test

The visual regression test works using [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).
In one console/terminal run `yarn start` wait for the application to be up and then open another console/terminal run.

```
yarn test
```

You can also watch the visual tests running while running, to watch use command (Cypress window will appear and you can click the test to watch).

```
yarn test:open
```

## Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

`yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

`yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
